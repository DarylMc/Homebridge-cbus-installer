# Homebridge-cbus-installer

#### A bash script & companion files to make it as easy as possible to install [Homebridge-cbus](https://github.com/anthonywebb/homebridge-cbus) on your Raspberry Pi.

Based on [the brilliant setup documentation](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ANlD74Wg0RsHv98&id=142E343EE7CCA768%2119603&cid=142E343EE7CCA768) from [Daryl McDougall](https://github.com/DarylMc).

All you need to get underway is:
- a Raspberry Pi with microSD card, power supply and box.
- a HDMI monitor & keyboard (to get the initial config on the Pi).
- a static IP address on your local network (for the Pi).
- A C-Bus network!
- The "tags" file from your network's C-Gate.

[SETUP.md](SETUP.md) takes you through all the steps. 

The easy to follow setup process:
- shows you how to get the Pi on your network, from first power-on.
- updates your Pi.
- downloads this repo and its supporting files, then the setup script (in this repo) takes over and automates all that's possible, including some useful tools and hitherto unseen shortcuts.


## Issues?

If you encounter any problems, the trick is to figure out if it's a bug in the script, or a bug in the _process_. If you're not sure, jump to the [Issues](/Issues) tab here, log it and we'll have a look at it.

## Credits

This repo is really just adding a scripted wrapper around Anythony's [Homebridge-cbus](https://github.com/anthonywebb/homebridge-cbus) & Daryl's [brilliant setup documentation](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ANlD74Wg0RsHv98&id=142E343EE7CCA768%2119603&cid=142E343EE7CCA768).

These guys - and all who've contributed to the project over several years deserve the credit.
